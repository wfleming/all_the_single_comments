# All The Single Comments

GitHub's new [Code Reviews][1] have some nice aspects, but I still like to
leave individual comments in many cases, and I also don't like having to reach
for a mouse to submit a comment.

Pressing `Ctrl-Enter` (or `Cmd-Enter` on OS X) used to add a comment, but now
it starts a review. This plugin gives you a new shortcut to add a single
comment.

## Usage

When in a comment form on a Pull Request, press `Ctrl-Shift-Enter` (or
`Cmd-Shift-Enter` on OS X) to add your comment as a single comment without
starting a review.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser.
3. Click "Load unpacked extension...".
4. Navigate to the cloned repo & load it.
